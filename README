Making changes
--------------

1. make the change and test and stuff
2. add an entry to the changelog (dch -i -c kernel-debian/changelog)
3. the new version number should probably reflect the version of the kernel
   being used, in case it changes
4. if you change the package revision (KERNEL_SM_REV in Makefile), that will
   change the names of the generated packages
5. for plain packaging changes, just increment the debian revision (the part
   after the - in the package version, found at the top line of
   kernel-debian/changelog)
6. to upload to the space monkey apt repo, in unstable:


 SPACE_LEVEL=unstable upload-new-debs path/to/spacemonkey-base-image*.changes \
     apt.spacemonkey.com


Using
-----

just "make" should do everything you need, downloading kernel source if
necessary, comparing it against a known hash, extracting and patching it,
putting the debian packaging files in place, and building.

you'll get the kernel package itself (which includes the few modules we build),
a headers package, and a snapshot of the source tree used as the source debs.
